## **Congratulations, you're having a baby!**

The first rule of baby club is there are no rules! Every baby is different and for the most part nothing will go according to plan. But here's what worked for us and hopefully it will work for you too.

### **At the hospital**

I had a Cesarean birth (again!). The gist of it is: we checked into the hospital at a predetermined time, my baby was delivered within the first 15 minutes of the procedure and I was in and out of the operating room in an hour or so. The first 12 hours post-op was hard the first time because I didn’t get the right dosage of pain meds, and the second time because of some connection between abdominal surgery and the back of my neck feeling intense pain. But everything did resolve and I was up and walking in that same time period. 

You need less than you think at the hospital. I wore robes, socks, and mesh underwear provided by the hospital. One thing no one told me was how sweaty you get after giving birth, something to do with all the hormones, so it was nice wearing the hospital stuff that I didn't care about. I recommend bringing:

### **For you**

- **Toiletries** (lip balm, toothbrush, toothpaste, face wash, mouth wash, moisturizers, etc)
- **Snacks** like granola bars and nut butter packets.
- **Broth or any clear fluids** with electrolytes. I made my own broth and brought that to the hospital, it was really good especially after surgery and not having had any food for almost 24 hours.
- **Clothes** for going home. The baby's out but you'll still look about 6 months pregnant, bring comfortable clothes.
- **[Earth Mama Nipple Butter](https://amzn.to/2KWqVue)** If you want to breastfeed, it's nice to have some nipple butter handy.

### **For baby**

- **Clothes** for going home. Baby will have an umbilical cord stump, bring kimono style clothes that won't bother the stump. Baby won't really need clothes, hospital provides a long sleeve top, swaddle, and hat, but there's something special about going home in new (first!) clothes.
- **Infant car seat**, you’ve got to have one to leave the hospital.
- **Formula** Hopefully you'll have no trouble breastfeeding from the get go. But just in case, if you're like me, it'll be a few days before your milk comes in. You don’t have to bring this to the hospital but I recommend having it on hand at home so you’re not panicked in the middle of the night. We got [Hipp formula](https://www.hipp.com/).

### **The Stuff!**

Highly recommend finding your local parent group (Facebook, unfortunately, is a decent resource for this) before baby is born. Between friends' hand-me-downs and our local group, we managed to get a lot stuff for free or cheap.

### **Transport**

We’ve gone full Uppababy, continuing with the [UPPAbaby Cruz](https://amzn.to/31SON8Y) stroller frame, **[Mesa carseat](https://uppababy.com/mesa/)**, and the [bassinet](https://amzn.to/2Z7x0xN). We also got the piggback ride-a-long board extension to accommodate two kids. 

For carriers, we have the **[Beco Gemini](https://becobabycarrier.com/collections/beco-gemini)**. It’s sturdy and can handle a newborn up to a 2-year-old (depending on their size). 

We still have the [Boba Air Carrier](https://amzn.to/2HiUXaC) that's much more lightweight for travels. Saves a ton of space because it packs up into itself. We did 1.5 months in SE Asia with a 4 month old in this!

### **Sleeping**

Oh the [SNOO](https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/snoo-smart-bassinet). We tried it with baby #2, long story short, we ended up using it as a regular, non-moving bassinet. The gentle rocking was nice and maybe kept him sleeping a tad longer but the more intense levels just made him more mad. Works for many babies tho!

Swaddle your baby! We used the swaddle blankets that we got from the hospital for a couple of nights then very quickly switched over to the [Ollie Swaddle](https://amzn.to/31VLzkV). Instead of zippers and little tabs of velcro, it's just one flat piece of fabric with huge pieces of velcro, incredibly easy to maneuver and hard to break free from.

We use these [Aden and Anais Swaddles](https://amzn.to/2HAUfWj) as lightweight blankets and stroller shade/covers.

[Hatch Baby Sound Machine and Night Light](https://amzn.to/31SpjIH) for white noise. We now use the color changes to cue our older child when it’s okay to wake (us) up. It’s also nice to be able to control it with our phones.

We keep an eye on the baby with [Nanit](https://amzn.to/31SIXEl). It's bluetooth and WiFi enabled, so you can take it on the road with you when you travel. We're data nerds, so it's great that it also provides motion and sound alerts, temperature and humidity monitoring, and it can even tell you your baby's sleep quality.

### **Diapering**

[Pampers Swaddlers](https://amzn.to/2pisxHF) gets the job done. When you get one too many blowouts, it’s time to size up. You won’t need to know this right now but when it happens, it’ll resonate.

[Hatch Baby Changing Pad and Scale](https://amzn.to/320oFJl) or the [Keekaroo](https://amzn.to/31VGtVH). The scale is nice if you're breastfeeding and want to know how much milk your baby is getting.

[Ubbi Diaper Pail](https://amzn.to/31QrZ9E)

[WaterWipes](https://amzn.to/2ZkLLIX)

[Storq's quick change diaper bag](https://storq.com/products/clutch-diaper-change-bag) is both functional and very cool looking.

[Hiccapop Wipe Warmer](https://amzn.to/2MYh6PZ) It makes the middle of the night diaper changes less stressful. 

### **Feeding**

[ComoTomo](https://uppababy.com/mesa/) bottles worked for us. 

[Drying Rack](https://amzn.to/2Uhk82d) You'll need it for all the oddly sized bottle and breast pump parts.

[Bottle Brush](https://amzn.to/2Pkl8nr) All that oddly sized bottle and breast pump parts will need to be cleaned properly.

[Burp Cloths](https://amzn.to/2NF8q05) Get lots of burp cloths! These are soft and inexpensive.

[Seventh Generation Dish Soap](https://amzn.to/2ZxteJd)

### **Breastfeeding**

[Boppy Breastfeeding Pillow](https://amzn.to/2zBXSa2) When baby is small, it's good to have a pillow to level them up to your boobs. Later on, we use it as a lounger. She's also taken naps wedged in it for a while (supervised, of course!)

[Haakaa Manual Breast Pump](https://amzn.to/2NJc8G0) This thing is amazing! It expresses milk by suction, you just pop this sucker on and go about your business. It's small, lightweight, and portable. With my second baby, I mostly used this to help clear clogs. Warm water + Epsom salt, suction it to the boob and massage the clog out. I had clogs almost every other week for 4 months. 

For pumping, I got the [Elvie Stride](https://www.elvie.com/en-us/shop/elvie-stride). It’s the “upgrade” option with insurance, which means I paid $70+ with FSA funds for it. I like that it’s a cup and doesn’t require special bras and weird flanges protruding from my body. The main pump component can be clipped on which is so handy (or shall I say, hands-free!) when dealing with a newborn and a toddler. 

For storage bags, never had a problem with freezing and thawing with [Medela](https://amzn.to/2MOCHKv) bags.

### **Cleaning**

[Stokke Flexi Tub with newborn support](https://amzn.to/2zCYLin) It's basically a bucket that folds up. The newborn support is sturdy and holds thebaby up well. Love that this doesn't take up a ton of space when not in use.

[Baby Bathtub Seat](https://a.co/24y5Jmt) We didn't use this with our first but our second baby was very wiggly once he was out of the newborn stage. This seat was helpful to keep him in place. 

[Hooded towel](https://pehr.com/collections/petit-hooded-towel) They lose body heat really quickly, the hood helps to keep them a little warmer. These Pehr hooded towels are surprisingly cozy.

[Puracy Body Wash and Lotion](https://amzn.to/2NHF6X1) This smells soooo nice.

[Wash cloths](https://amzn.to/2LiHbG8)

### **Health, etc.**

Nail clippers and file. We just used a baby nail file for the first few weeks. You'll see that there's still some skin covering their nails in the beginning. Now, we use this [nail clipper](https://amzn.to/2ZHO3Si).

[Nose Aspirator](https://amzn.to/2ZMiMxW) Even with a humidifier going all night, our baby was congested. This aspirator is great, clear out the nose and takes care of the boogers.

[Thermometer](https://amzn.to/2ZHlYur) It's a smart thermometer that beeps the reading to your phone. We love data!

[Mam Pacifiers](https://amzn.to/2LbpEAM) Pacifiers are controversial. When do you give it to them? Should you give it to them? We introduced the pacifier around week 4 and never looked back.

[Comb and brush](https://amzn.to/2zHolmG)

### **Clothing**

Our winter baby lived in bodysuits. Loved the Primary footed suits. Rotated through 5 of them until he grew out of them. 

This [Mamaowl merino wool body suit](https://mamaowl.net/en-us/collections/baby-wool-outerwear/products/organic-merino-wool-fleece-suit-slate) was a real hit. Baby was comfortable in it when we'd go out whether in a carrier or in the stroller, and when we'd get home, he'd snooze comfortably in it (unbuttoned). 

Don't bother with baby socks, they won't stay on. These [booties](https://amzn.to/2PvjkIs), however, do stay on and are adorable.

### **Play**

[BabyBjorn Bouncer](https://amzn.to/2ZDRaL1) We knew NOTHING with our first kid! We didn’t use it till she was about 3 months. With our second, he was in it from the moment he got back from the hospital. 

Lovevery [Play Gym](https://amzn.to/2NGXy1W) Nice to give them distractions while doing tummy time. It's also amazing when they start to see things and bat at them for the first time.

Books! Read to your baby, they love it. Here's a [classic one](https://amzn.to/2NI6P9Z) to start with.
