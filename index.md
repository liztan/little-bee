## Congratulations, you're having a baby!

The first rule of baby club is there are no rules! Every baby is different and for the most part nothing will go according to plan. But here's what worked for us and hopefully it will work for you too. 

<!--I had a Cesarean birth. The day of our delivery, we very calmly gathered our things and went over to the hospital for our appointment. While waiting for the procedure, doctors, anesthesiologists, and nurses explained their roles and answered all of my lingering questions. They also placed an IV port and scanned the belly one more time. I walked into the OR with the team and got a spinal block administered (eek!). I felt overwhelming nausea as soon as I laid down so the anesthesiologist gave me some medicine for it. The teeth-chatter and trembling, however, cannot be medically fixed. I just tried to focus my attention on breathing. Shortly thereafter, my partner joined me in the OR.  Within 15 minutes or so, our baby was delivered. 45 minutes or so later, I was wheeled into the recovery room with a newborn in tow. -->

### At the Hospital
I had a Cesarean birth. The gist of it is: we checked into the hospital at a predetermined time, my baby was delivered within the first 15 minutes of the procedure and I was in and out of the operating room in an hour. The recovery was very rough once the morphine wore off (eek!).

You need less than you think at the hospital. I wore robes, socks, and mesh underwear provided by the hospital. One thing no one told me was how sweaty you get after giving birth, something to do with all the hormones, so it was nice wearing the hospital stuff that I didn't care about. I recommend bringing:

#### For you
- **Toiletries** (toothbrush, toothpaste, face wash, body wash, mouth wash, moisturizers, etc)
- **Snacks** like granola bars and nut butter packets.
- **Broth or any clear fluids** with electrolytes. I made my own broth and brought that to the hospital, it was really good especially after surgery and not having had any food for almost 24 hours.
- **Clothes** for going home. The baby's out but you'll still look about 6 months pregnant, bring comfortable clothes. 
- **[Earth Mama Nipple Butter](https://amzn.to/2KWqVue)** If you want to breastfeed, it's nice to have some nipple butter handy. 

#### For baby
- **Clothes** for going home. Baby will have an umbilical cord stump, bring kimono style clothes that won't bother the stump. Baby won't really need clothes, hospital provides a long sleeve top, swaddle, and hat, but there's something special about going home in new (first!) clothes. 
- **[Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat](https://amzn.to/2ZhtRqq)** Got to have a car seat to leave the hospital.
- **Formula** Hopefully you'll have no trouble breastfeeding from the get go. But just in case, if you're like me, it'll be a few days before your milk comes in. We had a jaundice scare because I wasn't producing enough (or really, at all). Unless you are okay with Similac or something similar, I suggest bringing your own formula. We got [Hipp formula](https://www.hipp.com/).

### The Stuff!
Highly recommend finding your local parent group (some are called "Hui" meaning "community" in Hawaiian) before baby is born. Between friends' hand-me-downs and our local Hui, we managed to get a lot stuff for free or cheap.

#### Transport
We use the [UPPAbaby Cruz](https://amzn.to/31SON8Y) stroller with the [bassinet](https://amzn.to/2Z7x0xN) and have an [adapter](https://smile.amazon.com/UPPAbaby-Infant-Seat-Adapter-Chicco/dp/B00OC8WJU0/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1CT5TYXURCXG4&keywords=uppababy+chicco+infant+car+seat+adapter&qid=1566330624&s=gateway&sprefix=uppababy+chicco+%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-2) for our [Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat](https://amzn.to/2ZhtRqq). The bassinet is very handy because the baby can go from outside to inside without needing to be moved out of the carrier. Also good as an extra sleeping place for baby around the house, like the bathroom when you desperately need a shower.

For carriers we loved the [Sakura Ring Sling](https://sakurabloom.com/collections/shop-all/products/flax) for when she was a newborn. We've since graduated to a sturdier carrier like the Beco and we're experimenting with the [Boba Air Carrier](https://amzn.to/2HiUXaC) that's much more lightweight for our travels.

#### Sleeping
We were fortunate to have a [Monte Rockwell Bassinet](https://amzn.to/31YlEJx) loaned to us. It's space efficient and very cozy for the baby. One thing we discovered early on was that our baby didn't like the rocking motion, so we wedged small towels under the rocker and voila, a stand-still bassinet. 

Swaddle your baby! We used the swaddle blankets that we got from the hospital for a couple of nights then very quickly switched over to the [Ollie Swaddle](https://amzn.to/31VLzkV). Instead of zippers and little tabs of velcro, it's just one flat piece of fabric with huge pieces of velcro, incredibly easy to manuever. We've used it since she was a new babe and we're still using it at 12 weeks! 

Our girl broke out of regular swaddles, but swaddles cloths are really useful. We use these [Aden and Anais Swaddles](https://amzn.to/2HAUfWj) as lightweight blankets and stroller shade/covers.

White noise machine is very calming. I've found that I sleep better with it as well. We have the [Hatch Baby Sound Machine and Night Light](https://amzn.to/31SpjIH). We like that it can be controlled with our phones and in the future we look forward to cueing our kid when it's okay to wake (us) up. 

We keep an eye on her with the [Nanit](https://amzn.to/31SIXEl). It's bluetooth and WiFi enabled, so you can take it on the road with you when you travel. We're data nerds, so it's great that it also provides motion and sound alerts, temperature and humidity monitoring, and it can even tell you your baby's sleep quality. 

#### Diapering
[Pampers Swaddlers](https://amzn.to/2pisxHF) gets the job done. We experimented with [Dyper](https://getdyper.com/?ref=liztan) which are compostable and they offer a subscription service, but we found ourselves back with Pampers. 

[Hatch Baby Changing Pad and Scale](https://amzn.to/320oFJl) or the [Keekaroo](https://amzn.to/31VGtVH). The scale is nice if you're breastfeeding and want to know how much your baby ate. 

[Ubbi Diaper Pail](https://amzn.to/31QrZ9E) 

[WaterWipes](https://amzn.to/2ZkLLIX)

[Skip Hop Travel Changing Mat](https://amzn.to/2HlcjTZ) 

[Hiccapop Wipe Warmer](https://amzn.to/2MYh6PZ) Didn't think we'd be those people but she really hated a cold wipe to the butt in the middle of the night and we hated seeing her cry. At 3-months she's fine now and don't mind a cold wipe but we still think it's a classy touch.


#### Feeding
We started with [ComoTomo](https://amzn.to/2MJty5S) bottles, it was okay until she suddenly started hating it. We tried Avent, Life Factory, and Dr. Brown's bottles. We tried changing the nipple to increase the flow. We realized after a lot of crying that the problem was with the milk and not the bottle. That said, we can't really recommend one bottle over another, the one thing we were grateful for was not buying too many of one kind of bottle, you never know which one you'll end up with. 

[Drying Rack](https://amzn.to/2Uhk82d) You'll need it for all the oddly sized bottle and breast pump parts.

[Bottle Brush](https://amzn.to/2Pkl8nr) All that oddly sized bottle and breast pump parts will need to be cleaned properly.

[Burp Cloths](https://amzn.to/2NF8q05) Get lots of burp cloths! These are soft and inexpensive.

[Seventh Generation Dish Soap](https://amzn.to/2ZxteJd)

#### Breastfeeding

[Boppy Breastfeeding Pillow](https://amzn.to/2zBXSa2) When baby is small, it's good to have a pillow to level them up to your boobs. Later on, we use it as a lounger. She's also taken naps wedged in it for a while (supervised, of course!)

[Haakaa Manual Breast Pump](https://amzn.to/2NJc8G0) This thing is amazing! It expresses milk by suction, you just pop this sucker on and go about your business. It's small, lightweight, and portable. 

You get a free breast pump with insurance (Thanks, Obama!) but you're limited to whichever brand and model they cover. I use the [Ameda Finesse](https://amzn.to/2zEjDWD) pump and it's serving me well. I like that it's a closed system meaning the milk doesn't come in contact with the pump and that it's relatively small so it's easy to lug around. 

For storage bags, I've used Ameda and [Medela](https://amzn.to/2MOCHKv) ones, never had a problem with freezing and thawing with either.

#### Cleaning

[Stokke Flexi Tub with newborn support](https://amzn.to/2zCYLin) It's basically a bucket that folds up. The newborn support is sturdy and holds her up well. Love that this doesn't take up a ton of space when not in use.

[Hooded towel](https://amzn.to/2zBo3xB) They lose body heat really quickly, the hood helps to keep them a little warmer.

[Puracy Body Wash and Lotion](https://amzn.to/2NHF6X1) This smells soooo nice.

[Wash cloths](https://amzn.to/2LiHbG8) 


#### Health, etc.

Nail clippers and file. We just used a baby nail file for the first few weeks. You'll see that there's still some skin and stuff covering their nails in the beginning. Now, we use this [nail clipper](https://amzn.to/2ZHO3Si). 

[Nose Aspirator](https://amzn.to/2ZMiMxW) Even with a humidifier going all night, our baby was congested. This aspirator is great, clear out her nose and takes care of the boogers.

[Thermometer](https://amzn.to/2ZHlYur) It's a smart thermometer that beeps the reading to your phone. We love data!

[Mam Pacifiers](https://amzn.to/2LbpEAM) Pacifiers are controversial. When do you give it to them? Should you give it to them?  We introduced the pacifier around week 4 and never looked back. 

[Comb and brush](https://amzn.to/2zHolmG)

#### Clothing

Our late-spring newborn didn't need a lot of clothes. She hung out in a [kimono top](https://amzn.to/2zHmXjG), a diaper and a swaddle for most of her first few weeks of life. It's a lot of work to take off and put on clothes, plus they don't really get dirty. We got more into changing her later on after the umbilical stump is out and she's sturdier. Also, because blowouts. 

Don't bother with baby socks, they won't stay on. These [booties](https://amzn.to/2PvjkIs), however, do stay on and are adorable.

#### Play

[BabyBjorn Bouncer](https://amzn.to/2ZDRaL1) She started to be able to sit in it around 3 months. Definitely get the toy bar. 

[Play Gym](https://amzn.to/2NGXy1W) Nice to give them distractions while doing tummy time. It's also amazing when they start to see things and bat at them for the first time. 

Books! Read to your baby, they love it. Here's a [classic one](https://amzn.to/2NI6P9Z) to start with.
