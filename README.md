## Congratulations, you're ready to share your own baby tips! 

When I started down this journey of parenthood, I received a dizzying amount of documents and spreadsheets. Some of these documents were made just for me, but most of them were a collection of additions, edits, and post scripts by many parents who came before me. 

I made this list here so that it's easier for others to copy, add to, or create an entirely new list. 

I'm interested in seeing how this list evolves with time as it passes through other hands.
