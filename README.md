## Congratulations, you're having a baby!

The first rule of baby club is there are no rules! Every baby is different and for the most part nothing will go according to plan. But here's what worked for us and hopefully it will work for you too. 

<!--I had a Cesarean birth. The day of our delivery, we very calmly gathered our things and went over to the hospital for our appointment. While waiting for the procedure, doctors, anesthesiologists, and nurses explained their roles and answered all of my lingering questions. They also placed an IV port and scanned the belly one more time. I walked into the OR with the team and got a spinal block administered (eek!). I felt overwhelming nausea as soon as I laid down so the anesthesiologist gave me some medicine for it. The teeth-chatter and trembling, however, cannot be medically fixed. I just tried to focus my attention on breathing. Shortly thereafter, my partner joined me in the OR.  Within 15 minutes or so, our baby was delivered. 45 minutes or so later, I was wheeled into the recovery room with a newborn in tow. -->

### At the Hospital
I had a Cesarean birth. The gist of it is: we checked into the hospital at a predetermined time, my baby was delivered within the first 15 minutes of the procedure and I was in and out of the operating room in an hour. The recovery was very rough once the morphine wore off (eek!).

You need less than you think. I wore robes, socks, and mesh underwear provided by the hospital. One thing no one told me was how sweaty you get after giving birth, something to do with all the hormones, so it was nice wearing the hospital stuff that I didn't care about. I recommend bringing:

#### For you
- **Toiletries** (toothbrush, toothpaste, face wash, body wash, mouth wash, moisturizers, etc)
- **Snacks** like granola bars and nut butter packets.
- **Broth or any clear fluids** with electrolytes. I made my own broth and brought that to the hospital, it was really good especially after surgery and not having had any food for almost 24 hours.
- **Clothes** for going home. The baby's out but you'll still look about 6 months pregnant, bring comfortable clothes. 
- **[Earth Mama Nipple Butter](https://amzn.to/2KWqVue)** You'll either end up down the breastfeeding or pump route, either way, you'll want some nipple butter. 

#### For baby
- **Clothes** for going home. Baby will have an umbilical cord stump, bring kimono style clothes that won't bother the stump. Baby won't really need clothes, hospital provides a long sleeve top, swaddle, and hat, but there's something special about going home in new (first!) clothes. 
- **[Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat](https://amzn.to/2ZhtRqq)** Got to have a car seat to leave the hospital.
- **Formula.** Hopefully you'll have no trouble breastfeeding from the get go. But just in case, if you're like me, it'll be a few days before your milk comes in. We had a jaundice scare because I wasn't producing enough (or really, at all). Unless you are okay with Similac or something similar, I suggest bringing your own formula. We got [Hipp formula](https://www.hipp.com/).

### The Stuff!
Highly recommend finding your local parent group (some are called "Hui" meaning "community" in Hawaiian) before baby is born. Between friends' hand-me-downs and our local Hui, we managed to get a lot stuff for free or cheap.

#### Transport
We use the [UPPAbaby Cruz](https://amzn.to/31SON8Y) stroller with the [bassinet](https://amzn.to/2Z7x0xN) and have an [adapter](https://smile.amazon.com/UPPAbaby-Infant-Seat-Adapter-Chicco/dp/B00OC8WJU0/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1CT5TYXURCXG4&keywords=uppababy+chicco+infant+car+seat+adapter&qid=1566330624&s=gateway&sprefix=uppababy+chicco+%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-2) for our [Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat](https://amzn.to/2ZhtRqq). The bassinet is very handy because the baby can go from outside to inside without needing to be moved out of the carrier. Also good as an extra sleeping place for baby around the house, like the bathroom when you desperately need a shower.

For carriers we loved the [Sakura Ring Sling](https://sakurabloom.com/collections/shop-all/products/flax) for when she was a newborn. We've since graduated to a sturdier carrier like the Beco and we're experimenting with the [Boba Air Carrier](https://amzn.to/2HiUXaC) that's much more lightweight for our travels.

#### Sleeping
We were fortunate to have a [Monte Rockwell Bassinet](https://amzn.to/31YlEJx) loaned to us. It's space efficient and very cozy for the baby. One thing we discovered early on was that our baby didn't like the rocking motion, so we wedged small towels under the rocker and voila, a stand-still bassinet. 

Swaddle your baby! We used the swaddle blankets that we got from the hospital for a couple of nights then very quickly switched over to the [Ollie Swaddle](https://amzn.to/31VLzkV). Instead of zippers and little tabs of velcro, it's just one flat piece of fabric with huge pieces of velcro, incredibly easy to manuever. We've used it since she was a new babe and we're still using it at 12 weeks! 

White noise machine is very calming. I've found that I sleep better with it as well. We have the [Hatch Baby Sound Machine and Night Light](https://amzn.to/31SpjIH). We like that it can be controlled with our phones and in the future we look forward to cueing our kid when it's okay to wake (us) up. 

We keep an eye on her with the [Nanit](https://amzn.to/31SIXEl). It's bluetooth and WiFi enabled, so you can take it on the road with you when you travel. We're data nerds, so it's great that it also provides motion and sound alerts, temperature and humidity monitoring, and it can even tell you your baby's sleep quality. 

#### Diapering
- Pampers Swaddlers gets the job done. But we've recently taken the bait and are trying out [Dyper](https://getdyper.com/?ref=liztan) which are compostable and it's a subscription service. 

- [Hatch Baby Changing Pad and Scale](https://amzn.to/320oFJl) or the [Keekaroo](https://amzn.to/31VGtVH). The scale is nice if you're breastfeeding and want to know how much your baby ate. 

- [Ubbi Diaper Pail](https://amzn.to/31QrZ9E) 

- [WaterWipes](https://amzn.to/2ZkLLIX)

- HiccaPop Wipe Warmer

- [Skip Hop Travel Changing Mat](https://amzn.to/2HlcjTZ)
